Tele-Wrist: Development of a 4 DOF End-Effector with Haptic Feedback

Abstract

Teleoperated surgical robotic procedures assist
surgeons in terms of precision and control. However, a primary
challenge is the high cost of platforms. The BILK System was
developed as a cost-effective alternative, yet faced limitations in
terms of limited maneuverability of the end effector and lack of
haptic feedback. This reduces the flexibility of procedures
capable for the system, as well as removes the tactile aspect of
procedures surgeon’s have come to rely on. Thus, the need exists
for development of an advanced end-effector capable of more
intricate procedures and feedback. The Tele-wrist is a 4 DOF
system consisting of a Master and Follower wrist. It is capable of
mapping a surgeon’s wrist motion and opening and closing of a
gripper with low latency, within a margin of ±10°, and providing
vibrational feedback on the Master side proportional to force
experienced during surgery on the Follower side.
